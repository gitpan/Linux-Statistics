1.01	Added the method new().
	Did some syntax improvements.
	Enlarged the test.pl script.
	Changed the keys NetSumStats and DiskSumStats
	  to NetStatsSum and DiskStatsSum.
	Thanks to David Serrano for his tipps about
	  the ugly sleep(1) in the getStats function.
	  I realized his suggestion in the new() method.
